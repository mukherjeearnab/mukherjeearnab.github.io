We used the Ethereum BigQuery dataset and labeled the dataset using the Mythril smart contract analysis tool. The implementation is partly based on the work of Wesley Joon-Wie Tann et al. in Towards Safer Smart Contracts: A Sequence Learning Approach to Detecting Security Threats. The DL model, based on LSTM architecture achieved an F-1 score of 97.85% during the tests.",
