As an _2nd Year_ M.Tech by Research student at **PLANR Lab, Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering, IIT Patna**, I am actively involved in a _MeitY-funded_ project called **HealthChain**. The project focuses on enhancing the _Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission_ platform by incorporating blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. Under the guidance of **Dr. Raju Halder** and **Dr. Joydeep Chandra**, I contribute to developing and implementing blockchain and federated learning-based solutions for healthcare systems, aiming to improve data security, interoperability, and transparency.

In addition to my work on the HealthChain project, I am strongly interested in distributed systems and web development. I actively explore and contribute to advancements in these areas, striving to develop robust and scalable systems. My research and coursework have equipped me with a deep understanding of the principles and practices behind these technologies.

Outside of academics and research, I am passionate about music, specifically playing the guitar and piano. I enjoy arranging pieces for the piano. Photography is another hobby I pursue, capturing moments and expressing my artistic perspective.
