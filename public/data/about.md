As an Junior Research Fellow at **PLANR Lab, Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering, IIT Patna**, I am actively involved in the _MeitY-funded_ project **HealthChain**. The project focuses on enhancing the _Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission_ platform by incorporating federated learning on top of healthcare data and blockchain-based traceability of healthcare records. Under the guidance of **Dr. Raju Halder** and **Dr. Joydeep Chandra**, I contribute to developing and implementing blockchain and federated learning-based solutions for healthcare systems, aiming to improve data security, scalability, and performance.

In addition to my work on the HealthChain project, I am strongly interested in distributed systems and machine learning. I actively explore and contribute to advancements in these areas, striving to develop robust and scalable systems. My research and coursework have equipped me with a deep understanding of the principles and practices behind these technologies.

Outside of academics and research, I am passionate about music, specifically exploring the depths of music theory and the mathematics behind it, and playing the guitar and piano. Photography is another hobby I pursue, capturing moments and expressing my artistic perspective. Few of my creative portfolios can be found [here](https://musescore.com/user/33838958) and [here](https://mukherjeearnab.github.io/photography). Apart from that, I like teaching computer science and mathematics to students.
