As an _2nd Year_ M.Tech by Research student at **PLANR Lab, IIT Patna**, I am actively involved in a _MeitY-funded_ project called **HealthChain**. The project focuses on enhancing the _Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission_ platform by incorporating blockchain technology. Under the guidance of **Dr. Raju Halder**, I contribute to the development and implementation of blockchain solutions for healthcare systems, aiming to improve data security, interoperability, and transparency.

In addition to my work on the HealthChain project, I possess a strong interest in distributed systems and programming language tools. I actively explore and contribute to advancements in these areas, striving to develop robust and scalable systems. My research and coursework have equipped me with a deep understanding of the principles and practices behind these technologies.

Outside of academics and research, I have a passion for music, specifically playing the guitar and piano. I enjoy arranging pieces for the piano. Photography is another hobby I pursue, capturing moments and expressing my artistic perspective.
